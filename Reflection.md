Reflection 

1.Where in your code did you use an array or a vector, and what does it store?
-I used 5 arrays placed before main and they store the color palette data including red, green, blue, purple, and yellow.
2.How did changing the color logic change the look of your fractal art?
-Changing the color logic had a drastic change on the look of my color fractal art in the way that raising the contrast values created sharper definition between the mandelbrot set and surrounding regions.
